# Train-Schedules
Train-schedules is a web app that uses firebase from google to store data entered from a html form. The information
entered is about trains and their schedule and destination. Uses moment.js to predict the next time a train is due to pass.
This web app is good to learn about the use of real time database of firebase service from google.
